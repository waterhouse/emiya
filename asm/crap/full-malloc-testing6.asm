        ;; Then, if I discover that they're all eqv,
        ;; I can choose the one that uses fewest registers/is most
        ;; convenient about its use.

        ;; So, since I'll probably generally want to leave a couple
        ;; of registers usable for the moving crap,
        ;; I probably don't really have a problem with register usage in
        ;; these things.

        ;; Want to test a bunch of permutations.
        ;; The cdrs must be generated automatically.
        ;; "car" -> "cdr" and "CONS_TAG]" -> "CONS_TAG + 8]".

        ;; Choices...
        ;; - The type check can be done with either "lea reg, [%2 - CONS_TAG]; test reg, 7"
        ;;   or something like "mov reg, %2; and reg, 7; cmp reg, CONS_TAG".
        ;; - The order of "fromspace_test" and "ptr_test" can be swapped.
        ;;   Logically, "fromspace_test" should go first in cdr, and seems reasonably
        ;;   likely it should go first in car as well.
        ;;   Not testing this atm.  (Using a bunch of lists of high or negative fixnums
        ;;    would be the case in which it sucked.  --I guess I could test a bit.)
        ;; - The call to the "move" thing can either be accomplished with a "call"
        ;;   that you normally jump across, or with a "lea reg, [return_addr]" followed
        ;;   by a conditional jump.
        ;; - The fromspace-ptr tests could be combined into a memory-operation-requiring
        ;;   thing: "mov reg, %1; and reg, 7; test %1, [fromspace_mask_table + 8*reg]".
        ;;   This was determined to be terribly expensive and bad.
        ;; - The 

        ;; All of these may wreck rax and shouldn't take it as args.

        ;; I don't really like the fact that you'll need a bunch of stubs for car and cdr barriers.

        ;; Also, the "aside" aspect... eh.
        ;; Meanwhile, I can easily write a macro that can do "cdr x, x" things that tests
        ;; whether %1 = %2, and if so, cdrs into something else and stores it back into x.

        ;; (generate a bunch of macros that are either "do nothing" or "ifidn x y, do nothing, else do z"
        ;;  and then have things that use the stub either redefine the macro or redefine x to something new
