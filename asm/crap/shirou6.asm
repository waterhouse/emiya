        ;; So, I am thinking.
        ;; - functions may be passed args in rest lists or in whatever
        ;; - this is indicated with the contents of rax
        ;; - - it seems nicer to have rax = 2*[plain args] + [1 if rest args, 0 oth.]
        ;; - there will be library subroutines for parsing n args out of this
        ;; - functions that take optional args may do some fancy shit after that
        ;; - keyword args seem probably to appear as plain args that happen to be
        ;;   certain things
        ;; - cooperative compilation would help with crap

        ;; Meanwhile, for doing list-star, actually,
        ;; it is probably helpful to eat chunks of args at once [not that the arglists
        ;;  will usually be very long].
        ;; Now...


        ;; btw the word of God (or a random thought) sez functions written here
        ;; should accept rest-args as register-args, and it is uapply that will

        ;;    Btw, this actually fits well, too, with deciding to invoke
        ;;    a gc flip well before you reach TOSPACE_TOP.
        ;; 3.

        ;; Aha.  I can achieve minimum granularity using MYSPACE_TOP.
        ;; I could always set MYSPACE_TOP = ALLOCPTR + 8, or even ALLOCPTR + 0,
        ;; and then allocs would always end up calling GC_WORK_OR_FLIP.
        ;; (Then, when gc work was done, it'd just bump it up to TOSPACE_TOP or wtvr.)
        ;; That is el goodo and I will do el thatto.

        ;; Issue.  Can I be sure I can make things fine if [current memory is filled
        ;;  before gc work is done]?

        ;; Answer seems to be yes.
        ;; It will cost a bit.
        ;; Just grab more dick, ensure that all prev. dick is "fromspace" atm,
        ;; and act like you've just gc-flipped.
        ;; First, "move" must check ... whether, when it finds a fwd ptr, it needs
        ;; to be moved itself.
        ;; Second, "trace" must ...
        ;; Well, when you're tracing an object, must check if it itself
        ;; has been moved. ...
        ;; If it has, then someone else has already signed up to trace it,
        ;; so you won't have to trace the moved thing.
        ;; In that case, the only problem is making sure you don't do terrible
        ;; things as a result of that... i.e. dereference bad pointers or replace
        ;; the forwarding ptr or the gc-next pointer with something new.
        ;; There are a couple of possible solutions.
        ;; - Ensure that fwd-ptr and gc-next are both 000-tagged, so tracing will
        ;;   have no effect.
        ;;   This makes following fwd-ptrs slower, as you have to put the tag back
        ;;   in, which sucks.  (Also it's not possible for both gc-next and fwd-ptr
        ;;   to lack a tag--at least one is necessary for the poor gc worker to
        ;;   figure out what it's tracing.)
        ;;   [... If there are things, such as blocks of code or shared closures
        ;;    or maybe arrays, where I don't want the gc-next to point to the front...
        ;;    ... Neh, that seems negligible.]
        ;; - Have tracing check whether the thing being traced has a fwd ptr.
        ;;   This slows down tracing, makes it more complex, and kinda sucks.
        ;; - Have tracing check whether the thing being traced is located in
        ;;   fromspace.
        ;;   This would also slow down tracing, but... it seems to have better
        ;;   performance characteristics...
        ;; ... And then there's also read-barring.
        ;; (Which leads to tracing, but in a slightly different context.)
        ;; ...
        ;; No...
        ;; That'd be addressed by the "moving" thing.  Not by the "tracing" thing.
        ;; User program will only see tospace ptrs.
        ;; If user program pulls a fromspace ptr out of a tospace object, it moves it.
        ;; Right.
        ;;

        ;; All right, I kind of hate a sacrifice this will force,
        ;; but it will fully address certain things without the need for brittle
        ;; cleverness.
        ;; - Tracing will check whether the thing being traced is located in
        ;;   fromspace.
        ;;   This is forced by the weird different kinds of tracing that you might
        ;;   expect to get from user-specified tracing for closures, weird things
        ;;   for vectors, and so on.
        ;;   You should never be tracing something that is in fromspace.
        ;; - Vector operations will have to do a bit of extra shit.
        ;;   As a consequence of this shit, if you are trying to get the nth elm
        ;;   of a vector, you may need to look through several vector corpses.
        ;;   In monotonically increasing order of their elements-copied/length field.
        ;;   You'll have to do a loop thing.
        ;;   Um...
        ;;   Oh, wow, I guess you kinda can look at the lengths you see to see if
        ;;   they ever decrease.  Wow.
        ;;   I love it when offhand sardonic remarks turn out to contain useful ideas.

        ;; All right.  No tracing w/o checking.  Moving must ...
        ;; Moving that finds a fwd ptr must check if that pts to fromspace.
        ;; Also, when moving things, you must check whether that overflows tospace.
        ;; Which sucks, but.
        ;; If branch prediction is all it's cracked up to be, then that should
        ;; make little difference.
        ;; Lessee...
        ;; Grab more memory either (a) when the total number of bytes of objects
        ;; saved from the last cycle exceeds, say, 80% of a semispace, or (b)
        ;; when you try to allocate memory and that plus # traced bytes would
        ;; exceed that threshold.  (In terms of amount of work... if you
        ;; have 80/20 old/new, then that implies all allocations are slowed down
        ;; by a GC work factor of 4... you really want time during which GC work
        ;; is not happening, especially if you use devious tactics on top of that--
        ;; versions of functions without read barriers and such.)
        ;; Hmm... I'm then tempted to put the ratio at 50% or something--if you
        ;; trace 50% or more of useful stuff [this implies a max of 62.5%], then
        ;; there will be a doubling.  At any rate, that should be easily changeable
        ;; at runtime.
        ;; But
        ;; --No, you fool!  The only way to guarantee that less than nn% will be
        ;; traced is to initiate a GC flip when less than nn% memory has been
        ;; allocated.
        ;; In *practice* memory will probably grow slower than that--all sorts of
        ;; garbage will be allocated in the form of continuation-closures and
        ;; whatnot.  In that case a policy of "double when > 50% or whatever" would
        ;; be useful.
        ;; However, we must also be prepared.

        ;; Incidentally, in the multithreading case, I suppose each thread could
        ;; assume that the other threads are attempting to allocate the same
        ;; size object, and then the one with the biggest may be likely to request
        ;; more memory...
        ;; Geh, neh.  Whatever about that.

        ;; Meanwhile, I think the main remaining issue is


        ;; imported from other investigations:
        ;; --
;; wow. I have unintentionally done a kind of "Fragger" test.
;; I guess it does make sense that it would have to give a chunk of
;; continuous addresses.  mmmyes, quite, yes.

;; ok, a good solution to dicks:
;; grab a large chunk of memory, larger than you need.
;; probably bump up gc work ratio.
;; and now ...
;; if you end up at 100%, with gc work ratio of 4,
;; then 80% of that is copied crap,
;; meaning that the total you might have is 120%.
;; you do another gc flip.
;; you throw away the previous gc-next crap.
;; and now ... actually, just by getting a destination semispace of size 200%,
;; you will be doing just fine.
;; (maintaining gc work ratio of 4, you'll be done at 150%)
;; only issue is if you're trying to allocate a gigantic object.
;; hmm...

;; Ok.
;; - If, at any time, you want to alloc, and GC is still happening, and
;; TOSPACE_TOP - ALLOCPTR < what you want to alloc, then clearly you need
;; more dick.  So get more dick and initiate a GC flip.
;; - If you want to alloc, and TOSPACE_TOP - ALLOCPTR leaves not enough,
;; and GC is in fact done, then initiate a GC flip and begin the next round
;; by allocating what you want.  (If you then find there's still not enough--
;; go to previous step.)
        ;; --

        ;; and then, regarding tagging and manipulating bits of to/fromspace...
        ;;
        ;; So, in normal usage, fromspace is 01 and tospace is 10, and the
        ;; TEST thing will distinguish them.
        ;; This is necessary so that the TEST mask can be switched without
        ;; regenerating code to switch the roles of from and tospace.
        ;;
        ;; Best thing, with "alloc pyramid beforehand and slowly inhabit it",
        ;; seems to be:
        ;; reside in 001 and 010,
        ;; when nec. expand into tospace=100 through 101 (with mask 100,
        ;; so that test 0 => fromspace),

        ;; Probably I could reverse that.
        ;; Whatever.
        ;; Routine expansion should work fine w/o static stuff.
        ;;
        ;; I think I have some prejudice towards "1 = not fromspace", but wtvr.
        ;; Prob. solved problem.
        
        
        ;; I guess this brings other kinds of advantages...

        ;; Btw, would be very bad to just fill up memory without stuff...
        ;; Would probably want "begin by tracing a certain amount" after a
        ;; forced, hasty doubling.
        ;; (Oh man more metaphors.  You really should plan out your pregnancies,
        ;;  and arrange for things beforehand.  Other people who would be
        ;;  involved in your plans would probably want you to tell them
        ;;  beforehand so they could prepare.  However, if you do get pregnant,
        ;;  they will have to deal with it, and it would be a total trashing of
        ;;  professional ethics for your doctor to say "Well, you didn't take my
        ;;  advice, so screw you and I'm not helping you" and demand that you
        ;;  abort your program.)
