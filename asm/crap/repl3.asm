	;; r11 belongs to the calling procedure.

	;; ALL RIGHT, REGARDING I/O.
	;; If input is from, say, a terminal, it may
	;; choose to flush output after, say, every newline or something.
	;; However, I suspect it is the case that output will never be
	;; flushed after 0 characters; in that case, if 0 characters are read,
	;; then that means EOF.
	;; It seems that, when typing into a terminal, ^D (i.e. EOF) makes a difference
	;; only when no characters were typed before it, because the terminal only
	;; does crap based on newlines. However, ^D^D is probably taken to mean "flush
	;; input, then EOF".
	;; ACTUALLY NO ^D DOES FLUSH INPUT AND FOR LISPS THAT DOESN'T TERMINATE A TOKEN (DUH)

	;; So. If you want to read a single line that's less than the buffer length,
	;; and if the source happens to submit it all at once, then a single "read"
	;; may suffice. Else, you will have to just keep re-reading.

	;; By convention, rax and rdx will be expected to be non-pointers.
	;; A function or set of functions that knows what it's doing may install non-zero tag info for rax/rdx,
	;; but general functions should expect to be able to put non-pointers in those registers without
	;; asking permission.

	;; On the stack, for now, return addresses will be left alone. This implies I won't be able to
	;; create new functions in places that will need to be moved (I and my program are not yet
	;; strong enough with the force to do that anyway; no assembling at the moment).
	;; Things that are put on the stack with the expectation that the GC will ensure they remain
	;; in the right place... will have their high bits tagged.
	;; Variables used by GC: B(ottom of free area), S(can pointer, starts below bottom), T(op of free area),
	;; k(onstant factor), SS(tack scanner)... for this implementation, I know the stack will be small
	;; and I won't use such stuff.
	;; Any or all of these variables could be preferentially kept in memory instead of (or in addition to)
	;; registers.
	;; k will probably be... a ratio of [bytes to trace]/[bytes to alloc now]. prob'ly put in memory.
	;; (Or code.)

	;; To determine whether something is in fromspace, need to CMP with... old fromspace.
	;; Which means need to store that fuckin' crap somewhere.
	;; Now it would be ideal to store the address of "fromspace" in code. Unfortunately, that would
	;; basically require RIP-relative addressing an
	;; Actually it's possible to do this, with the [rel <sym>] directive... And at least one
	;; of (RIP-relative, absolute) addressing
	;; is presumably legal on all architectures; otherwise you can't call functions or anything.
	;; Now... this requires that either the "fromspace" box never move, or that code get updated when it
	;; does move. Either shall be fine.

	;; Now, because it's bad to access crap across 8-byte boundaries, all allocations shall be 8-byte aligned.
	;; Probably. Maybe. (I can imagine something wanting, like, a byte-size field...)
	;; Well, for now, I'll round up all allocations to the next multiple of 8. This will also guarantee
	;; that pointers will in fact end with 000, which I can use for tagging. This makes low-bit tagging
	;; a good idea. The only problem is return addresses, whose low bits can't be controlled without
	;; some effort. However, it is doable in two instructions:
	;; push [rel addr] ;cause you're not allowed 64-bit operands for most functions, including push
	;; jmp dest
	;; <possible nops, so that addr is 8-byte aligned--this is for speed, not tagging>
	;; addr: [8 bytes, with a tag]
	;; <nops to make the tag>
	;; actual return address: (proceed with execution)

	;; So that's doable, and probably ideal. But it requires an assembler with more intelligence than
	;; I'm willing to rely on right now. So for now, things will be tagged on the stack by high bits.
