        ;; A program that uses operations like cons, car, cdr, and closure.
        ;; This is some shit the user can include to make a program like that work.

        ;; The user will "%include "gc-system.asm" at the top.
        ;; This will define a bunch of macros that may be used in the user's main program.
        ;; Then the user shall call "gc_footer" at the bottom.
        ;; This will define the "startup_sequence" label, all the startup code,
        ;;  and all the stub functions that are needed.
        ;; Now, there's a bunch of crap that I could choose to put in various places.
        ;; There are the variables like "fromspace_mask", and the jump tables I'll
        ;; define, and the saved_regs table.
        ;; (Closures and the fields before them will necessarily be in the main code.)
        ;; nasm seems to think I should put some of the above in a "data" section, different
        ;; from a "code" or "text" section.
        ;; (It prints a warning with "resq" in a non-data section, it seems.)
        ;; ("bss" section is for resq shit.)
        ;; (..............................
        ;;  Goddammit, according to section 7.9.2 nasm has various default section things,
        ;;  and none of them provides both "exec" and "write".
        ;;  So there's value in my writing shit.
        ;;  However, I could probably tell it to have it be writable and whatnot.
        ;;  Then I could actually run Racket shit.
        ;;  Which might obviate ... much of the startup_sequence I have to write.
        ;;  Possibly all the stuff that's not specific to Arc.)
        
        ;; Now, the info table at least must be defined, and basically therefore must appear,
        ;; after the main user code, because its size comes from the number of times the
        ;; user's code increments "alloc_count".
        ;; Can you have a data section after a code section?
        ;; If you have it after lexically, will nasm reorder them?
        ;; Would that be a problem?
        ;; Could be tested.
        ;; --Looks like: lexical permutations are legal, multiple bss sections and probably
        ;;  any sections are legal, and nasm does reorder them.
        ;; Well... 

        ;; Anyway, meanwhile, I haven't tested and chosen which of a few different
        ;; alloc. and other methods to use, so this will wait a bit...

        ;;    would be the case in which it sucked.  --I guess I could test a bit.)
        ;; - The call to the "move" thing can either be accomplished with a "call"
        ;;   that you normally jump across, or with a "lea reg, [return_addr]" followed
        ;;   by a conditional jump.
        ;; - The fromspace-ptr tests could be combined into a memory-operation-requiring
        ;;   thing: "mov reg, %1; and reg, 7; test %1, [fromspace_mask_table + 8*reg]".

        ;; Ok.
        ;; The next step is to schedule GC work.
        ;; Now.
        ;; This shit will happen at the alloc_overflow phases.
        ;; And conceivably also at the "grab_moar" things, when you're
        ;; moving an object and you overflow.
        ;; Now...
        ;; 1. One naive scheme would be to do GC work at alloc_overflow,
        ;;    but not at grab_moar.  This has the problem that if you
        ;;    repeatedly allocate 4080 bytes, then move a cons cell,
        ;;    you'll not do any GC work for a long time, and then get a
        ;;    large backlog, which will probably break real-time constraints.
        ;; 2. Doing GC work unconditionally at grab_moar likely leads to
        ;;    doing all the tracing at once.
        ;; 3. I'm not exactly sure what real-time constraints might be, but
        ;;    I suspect tracing 16K bytes of data at a time is ok.  If not,
        ;;    that can certainly be reduced.
        ;; 4. In multithreaded, there will be a serious need to have threads
        ;;    grab "pages" of memory at a time, and not go outside those pages.
        ;;    However, the "PAGELIMIT" pointer need not be the actual size of
        ;;    those pages; e.g. they could grab 100K at a time, but the PAGELIMIT
        ;;    ensure that they take a GC break every 2K or 4K bytes.
        ;;    (But actually, in multithreaded, most of the time you probably want
        ;;     dedicated GC threads to do most of the GC work, and main execution
        ;;     threads only join GC work when that has fallen relatively behind.)
        ;; 5. The GC system probably needs to keep track of the progress it's making.
        ;;    In particular, a general idea is to make (# bytes traced) >= 4*(# bytes newly alloc'd).

        ;; - An option is to have "move" allocate its shit somewhere else
        ;;   than "next place in front of ALLOCPTR".  Options include a separate alloc area,
        ;;   and an adaptation of Henry Baker's idea, in which I'd alloc down from PAGELIMIT.
        ;;   That would probably be the most efficient (and might be good for locality), though
        ;;   I might actually want to reserve a register for PAGELIMIT if I did that.
        ;; - Another is to just increment a score counter (prob. in memory) every time you
        ;;   move something.  I think I'll do this. ....... Then the grab_moar thing can
        ;;   check the "moved vs alloced" score.
