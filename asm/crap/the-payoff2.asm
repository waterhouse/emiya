        ;; looks like either Racket uses some weird-ass fixnum tagging system
        ;; that isn't multiplying by 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16,
        ;; or it runs its foreign calls with a way separate stack.
        ;; the latter seems most plausible (given that it seems to do weird
        ;; other shit with the stack).
