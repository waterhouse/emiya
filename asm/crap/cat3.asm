	;; OH FUCK ME
	;; r11 belongs to the calling procedure.

	;; ALL RIGHT, REGARDING I/O.
	;; If input is from, say, a terminal, it may
	;; choose to flush output after, say, every newline or something.
	;; However, I suspect it is the case that output will never be
	;; flushed after 0 characters; in that case, if 0 characters are read,
	;; then that means EOF.
	;; It seems that, when typing into a terminal, ^D (i.e. EOF) makes a difference
	;; only when no characters were typed before it, because the terminal only
	;; does crap based on newlines. However, ^D^D is probably taken to mean "flush
	;; input, then EOF".
	;; ACTUALLY NO ^D DOES FLUSH INPUT AND FOR LISPS THAT DOESN'T TERMINATE A TOKEN (DUH)

	;; So. If you want to read a single line that's less than the buffer length,
	;; and if the source happens to submit it all at once, then a single "read"
	;; may suffice. Else, you will have to just keep re-reading.

	;; YES THIS SUCCESSFULLY ECHOES INPUT
	;; so now we'll do some funky business...
