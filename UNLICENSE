The files directly contained in the arc3.1/ directory were written by Paul Graham and Robert Morris, and modified by me.  As arc3.1/copyright says, they are covered by the Perl Artistic License 2.0.

That seems to imply I'm supposed to document any changes, so: In arc3.1/ac.scm, I have (a) changed the way intra-symbol syntax ("ssyntax") expansion works, (b) added a "$" special form used to drop into Racket code, (c) made some optimizations and fixes [notably, to the implementation of set-car! and set-cdr!], and (d) made various other changes which are probably minor and irrelevant.  I've also modified arc3.1/as.scm to load some of my own Arc files on startup.

The original arc3.1 can still be found at: http://ycombinator.com/arc/arc3.1.tar

The rest of the files (including those in arc3.1/interpreters-etc/) are my doing [although I have certainly learned from others, and a few functions might be recognized from Paul Graham's "On Lisp"].  Apparently some legal institutions consider this fact to give me some authority over whatever devices you might use to read or copy my code.  Well, we wouldn't want you to be harassed by any legal institutions in my name, so let's perform a little ritual to ward off the bad spirits.  This ritual is called the Unlicense:
