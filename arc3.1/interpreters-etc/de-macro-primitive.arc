;so it occurred to me that, in all the code I immediately intend to use
;the above for, I'm not shadowing any global macros, so I could omit that crap.
;but nah.

;then there is how real correctness would deal with special forms:
;it should be "x is bound to if-object", not "x is 'if".

;Eghhhhhhhhhh...
;How the fuck do we do an eq-hash-table?
;... Or any kind of hash table, in fact.
;'Cause of mutation.
;Actually, probably no one has a solution...

;Some experimentation with SBCL shows:
;- SBCL's cons cells do appear to be 16 bytes each.
;  This appears to rule out things like having all objects contain
;  a field which is their current hash, and which is updated upon
;  any set-ca/dr operation.
;- Modifying a cons cell that has been used in a key in a hash table
;  does (although, spookily, not always--I suspect compiler-optimization
;  shenanigans) lead to that key not being recognized when you reuse it.
;  This is what I'd expect from a straightforward approach: "the results
;  are unspecified when you modify keys".
;Racket also says weird shit may happen if you modify keys in an equal-hash.
;I suspect ...
;Righto, I suspect that eq- and eqv-hashes use some kind of extra object-id
;field inside each object.
;(Alternatives are "same hash for everything, then use your comparison
; function to find the right object out of the list of all that have the
; same hash" and "use memory addresses for the hashing of objects represented
; in memory, and lazily re-sort the table upon every GC".  The latter sounds
; pretty terrible--but it seems to be fair: any more-clever scheme seems
; to probably involve at least an extra word of memory per object, in which
; case having an extra object id field is superior.)


;User closures should have "user-defined type" tags.
;Real closures have a real tag.
;User is expected to make real closures soon.

;Well, here we are at machine code again.
;Models:
;- Machine code alloc'd and free'd.
;--> In this case, things are quite static.
;    Only problems are if (a) we don't feel like doing alloc/free stuff
;    in the GC or (b) we actually want to free things a lot, in the
;    manner of a GC.
;- Machine code in GC-managed memory, each block of machine code
;  separately managed and moved.
;--> This is simplest on the garbage collector, but worst to the
;    machine code, in which all subroutines must either be called
;    through a global array or something, or be duplicated.
;    In particular, note that the code-block that every continuation
;    points to must be by itself.
;    This is pretty terrible.  Rejecting.
;- Machine code in GC-managed memory, with many machine-code functions
;  in the same contiguous block.
;--> This will have approximately the same performance characteristics
;    as the alloc/free model if code never becomes garbage.
;    However, if one is in the business of generating and throwing
;    away code a lot, this is probably better.
;    (One could sort of achieve stuff with a weak-pointer wrapper of
;     machine code, and ... epicycles. Sucks.)
;
;The second approach just sucks.  The third approach is best, but it is
;hard to implement.  I shall use the first approach for the moment, for
;booting.
;Fortunately, all these approaches can coexist just fine...

;[written earlier]
;Oh man.
;The booting will be easy.
;API:
;- closure = [codeptr env ...]
;- codeptr = machine code to be executed
;- [codeptr - 8] = ptr to "move me" (subroutine; returns with ret)
;- [codeptr - 16] = ptr to "trace me" (subroutine; returns with ret)
;;;;- [codeptr - 24] = ptr to "trace and execute me" (continuation; doesn't ret)
;;; ^ actually that's not necessary: "move me" should know about that.

;The booting crap can just be allocated outside the GC range
;and never moved.
;In that case, none of the above code-blocks will move the machine
;code ("me" = the closure).
;In the other model, 

;Note that, although "move me" and "trace me" should never appear
;in the codeptr field of a closure, "trace and execute me" will.
;Therefore, "trace and execute me" will need a couple of dickass
;fields in front of it as well--additional pointers to "move me" and
;"trace me".
;"move me" = move closure, leaving fwd ptr (in the codeptr field
;   of the corpse--it's ok, things shouldn't appear in negative
;   addr space) and installing ptr to "trace and execute me" in
;   the codeptr field of the ... ghola? I should come up with a
;   name for this ... "heir" seems good. ... yes.
;"trace me" = move anything saved in the closure. This can be as
;   function-specific as you like: if the compiler knows it doesn't
;   store anything that needs moving in its closure, then "trace me"
;   can immediately ret.  (Actually, in that case, "move me" should
;   just install "execute" in the codeptr field of the heir, and
;   there should be no "trace and execute me" code.)
;"trace and execute me" = what it says. Should pretty much be this:
;   "CALL trace_me; JMP execute".

;Note that, for GC-stack purposes, ...
;Huh.
;... Ok, yeah. For GC-stack purposes, ...
;Actually, because this is so good, if the compiler is smart, then
;if a closure's env is ...
;Ok, no. ...
;Ok, partially.
;In model #1, if a closure's env is empty, then the "move me" code
;can know that, and can not even put crap on someone's GC stack.
;However, in model #3, the closure's code ptr may have to be moved.
;And then ...
;Eh, well... ok, fine.  --No.
;Then you will have to change it to "trace and execute" and all
;of that crap.

;I have received a sign that, in model #3, closures should in fact
;contain ...
;Ok, never mind.
;(Nawp, there still seems to be no argument of putting things from
; a "module-compiled-together" into a closure structure over into
; RIP-relative things, assuming tracing the latter can be done.)

;Well, all right.
;Next iteration shall do the improved thing.
