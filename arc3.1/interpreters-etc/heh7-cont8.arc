;Closures: (list 'closure <closure-fn> <env>)
;closure-fn: (fn (ev k . args) ...)
;env: (list (list 'name val) ...)
;Usually, closure-fn:
;(fn (ev k . args)
;  (eval '(body) (new-env '(env) args arglist) k))
;However, call-cc's fn will be:
;(fn (ev k f)
;  (f k))
;Normally, k is a cont-closure.
;cont-closure: (list 'closure (fn (ev v) ...))

;I think I'll have a nicely named closure-fn thing.
;Rather than some weird-ass thing.

;All right.  I think shit is done here, so time for cleanup.

;Now that stuff works... things I can do.
;0. Example with amb. Pure user code. Meh.
;1. Threads, faked by screwing with ccall or smthg to sometimes
;   save the closure and call something else for a while. Screw
;   that for the moment.
;2. Serializing everything.
;   I like this.
;   Have a print function (I've done this)
;   that handles everything (I've done this)
;   to which you supply a mapping function that, like,
;   remaps things if desired [conceivably a predicate
;   and a mapper, in case want to tell exp. whether
;   a pred. was satisfied] (I haven't done this).
;   The mapper would, in particular, map all the #<procedure:...>
;   things to some arbitrary names. The computation could be
;   paused at random points, saved somewhere, and loaded
;   elsewhere and resumed.
;   Could put in a built-in timer somewhere, like number
;   of calls to ccall or smthg...

;Ok, so, want two procedures.
;The Racket write is ok for handling circular structures...
;... The Racket write, yes, but not the Arc write! The latter
;uses ac-denil on a structure before writing it.  Dick.
;So I would construct a duplicate modified structure and pass
;it to Racket write.  Racket write works for circular things,
;and it's probably the most standard sort of format. (I guess
; I could make my own version that always named things; then
; it wouldn't need to go through the whole thing twice or
; whatever.)
;--Or I do something completely different.  Bwahaha.  Let us proceed.

;... ok this finally works but it's absolutely terrible.
;still, can't argue with "works"...
;Btw, "alist" should be renamed, perhaps to "a-list", and "alist"
;should construct an alist.
;... Next will... um... dhnumb.

;(I am addressing the problem that, if I print the x chunk of code

; symbol "meh".  My "solution" is to ignore it, and to trust that
; when someone serializes a whole system, they'll probably print out
; a table in some recognized form. Therefore, the symbol "meh" as
; printed in the global-value table will probably refer to the code;
; then ... ok, not necessarily, but whatever. I could just add a
; known table as well. Note that the symbol "meh" and the meh-code
; object will be different objects and will have different numbers
; associated with them; the task is then to figure out which is which.
; So print a list where the first item is a list of code dicks.

;so the issue with call/cc is that there are two kinds of closures,
;user closures and conts, with diff. calling conventions (conts
; take no cont argument, closures take one cont argument), and
;if they have equal status, so that a given variable x could be
;bound to either a cont or a user closure, then that is problematic.
;me solves this by making call/cc wrap its cont in a user-closure.
;now time to check the Appel.
