;load this with ssx-load

;ok, what representation is it this time?
;shall we revert to `(closure ,env ,args ,body)?
;heh, why not.
;and then ... ah yes. my goal was to have some kind
;of exception handlers and crap...
;therefore...
;continuations.
;hmm...

;there was that experimental approach to making envs,
;where an item saved in the closure would describe the
;structure of the env field(s), and usually partial eval
;would eliminate all references to it.
;in a straight interpreter like this, this is a pretty
;dumb idea, because there is never more than one closure
;that shares a particular env structure.
;... however, I shall do it anyway. lolz.
;kk yeah...
;... hmm...
;actually, no. screw.

;I will want dynamic variables.
;Which will not actually be variables.
;As in Racket, they will be first-class objects, which will
;be called like functions (although I could change the latter)
;to obtain their value.
;I will probably have to think for a while about "space safety"
;with this crap. How it might be obtained.
;... Btw, should d(ynamic env) and e(nv) be completely separate,
;or can one be contained in the other?
;Fuck whatever. Neh.

;ok, so, I will need a special form to parameterize things.
;is there any point in having "parameterize multiple things"
;be a primitive?  I don't think so. maybe conceivably with atomic
;crap... but no, you don't lock anyone else, you just...
;mmmyes. "dwith" should just be a macro. meanwhile I shall
;have a "dlet".
;... actually... does dlet even need to be ... I think it can be
;a procedure.  --well, except for the body portion.
;'course, many things could be written with a "more primitive"
;procedure that takes a thunk, with the usual form written as a
;macro on top of that.
;is there any reason to prefer one over the other?
;well, macro output of the non-thunk form looks much better, and
;is less verbose.
;meanwhile, if most of your BS depends on thunks, as in Racket,
;then it's easy for some idiot to run some completely different
;language on top of it (although, if your compiler isn't amazing,
; it may be kinda slower than it should be).
;anyway, special forms for me for the moment.

;ok actually I'm going to imitate Arc and be like "making a macro
; from a fn can be a procedure".

;I am faced with a strong temptation to have macros not use the
;dynamic environment.
;Hmm...
;Recall that a macro is like saying (eval `(...)).
;So the question is then: should "eval" use the current dyn-env or not?
;...

;Hohoho. Racket provides a (current-parameterization).
;... As well as call-with-parameterization.

;By the way, quasiquote kind of could be a macro...
;... Interesting.
;If you say (eval `(...)), then what is used to compute
;the macro definitely depends on the current dyn-env.
;Therefore macex'ing should do that.
;As for how the result is eval'd--well, of course, yes.
;So, yes.
;Then what should user eval be?
;Well, ... if the user defined it as a procedure, then ...
;calling it would use the current dyn-env.
;A separate "eval in blank env" could be provided if desired.
;Also the lexenv could be specified, defaulting to nil.
;In the interest of laziness, I shall not provide that myself yet.
;However, user "apply" is definitely in core Arc.

;note that user "apply" will be bound to a tricky macro.
;(mc (f . args) (eval (cons `',f args))).
;that suffices.
;... actually, must be careful to have the right dyn-env.

;(= user-apply
;   `(macro (closure (f . args)
;                    ,(fn (d e f ag)
;                       (ucall 

;guh, generating code feels bad. oh well.

;... actually, it would appear that this would work just fine...
;(mac apply (f . xs) (cons f xs))
;Assuming it is fine ...

;(let xs '(1 2 3)
;  (apply + xs))
;->
;(let xs '(1 2 3)
;  (+ . xs))
;->
;...
;Oh fuck, no, does not work.
;(apply f (cdr xs)) â‰  (f cdr xs).
;Ok, so much for any remnants of the idea that "compose" behavior
;with macros could be justified in an interpreter unless it took
;care of that in an ssexpansion phase.

;Well, then. Back to "apply" being nonsensical on a macro.
