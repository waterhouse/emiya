;Let's see if I can rederive crap from scratch...
;crap being CPS.

;...
;I... shall I use Shivers's thing,
;where ((fn dicks ass) nerf) is an acceptable CPS
;expression?
;I suppose I might as well.
;The alternatives involve either potentially-infinite
;expansion, global analysis to extract things,
;or some semi-silly FIX form that isn't global.

;We shall assume (and, separately, ensure)
;input that is a fully macex'd and desyntax'd Arc expression.
;(... Yes, that can be done in essentially a single pass;
; if a macro generates ssyntax output somehow, at least it'll
; only be in the resulting expression.  --This assumes no one
; mutates the source code while you're examining it. Hoo boy.)

;Eh... I guess it's even possible that I could
;interleave these two things.
;But eh.

;I decided that QUOTE things should be perceived as constants.
;If the structure must be constructed at runtime, then someone
;will have to figure out about that.
;(Like, if the procedure will construct a new one every time
;it's called, then that violates the semantics of QUOTE.
;If you want to quote some nontrivial data structure, like a
;list, and if your runtime doesn't support lists being in
;some kind of file-mmap'd, read-only portion of memory that
;gets mmap'd when you execute a file or load a shared library,
;then your runtime had better figure out how to deal with that,
;allocating such a list in a place of memory that it can handle
;at the time that the code is compiled or loaded--perhaps when
;it's run for the first time (perhaps that also means compiled
;with JIT compilation)--and storing a pointer to it in a place
;that the code can access, and maintaining such a pointer
;when/if the list is moved by the GC.
;If your runtime doesn't support QUOTE, then certainly I don't
;have to handle it here.)

;Ok, so, here I face the question:
;((actually-fn) (x) (+ x 3))
; where (actually-fn) = (macro () 'fn)
;leads to what?
;In my interpreter, that is definitely the same
;as (fn (x) (+ x 3)).
;In arc3.1 and Racket and Chicken
;[lolz, I go about 5 things up in rlwrap csi history and I find
; this exact example]
;and sbcl, that is an error.
;A macro that simply expands to the name of a macro is an error,
;in these languages.
;I dislike this...
;However, I seem to be giving in to having macros locked in at
;compile time, and needing to hack in the proper behavior
;through other means in some other way.
;Mmm...
;I think I shall hold fast to that.
;So.

;... Conservative approximation.
;... Fuck.

;Semantically, I think it is important to have what some call

;I'm going for the first, and having them defined as macros.
;Fortunately, ... ... how was I going to finish that sentence?
;Ah, yes: fortunately, (dick x) that macex's to (quote x) is still
;treated the same in arc3.1 as (quote x) in the first place.

;So.
;This basically should, I think, return an expression made up purely
;of (bq-cons x y) and (bq-quote x).  That is to say:
;expr = (bq-quote <anything>) or (bq-cons expr expr).
;I guess one can be excessively dumb and bq-quote numbers anyway.
;And then have bq-quote macex somewhat nicely.
;(Or not.)

;(the alternative approach is somehow returning multiple

;...
;what if...
;`(,2 ,3)

;Racket sez yes.

;#t
;> (define (meh x) `(,x ,2 3))

;ok, this fuckin' terrible shit works now
;jesus christ
;I would want to beta-reduce fuckin' crap
;but I think I should closure-convert before I do that
;and to closure-convert, I shall need to know about free variables
;and speaking of which, I should figure out about renaming dicks.
;let us do that.

;we will let the first binding of "v" remain "v",
;and subsequent bindings should become "v1", "v2", ... .
;now, if someone happens to have named a variable "v1"
;already, then this will cause a little problem.
;we would then rename _that_ variable "v3" or wtvr.
;thus, we need to parse out the last number from an
;existing var.
;we shall have a hash table of renamings.
;... shall I do this destructively?
;mmm...

;free vars will be left alone.
;(like constants and shit)
;be careful not to rename nil.

;to compute the renaming for vn,
;we simply find the first v[n+k]
;for which there isn't a binding in the table.
;hmm...
;ok.
;hmm... in this...
;fn and quote are the special forms.
;(interestingly, both will eventually imply entries in a FIX)
;I suppose there's also assign, which hasn't been conv'd yet.
;oh well.
;... if no renaming is needed, I think I can just rename
;a variable to itself. bweheheh.
;... I think I shall have no var0's,
;and I think I shall never rename var[n] to var[m < n].
;so, given var[], I compute n to be 0,
;and given var and n, I look at var[n] and then var[n+1]
;and so on.
;if there's a fuckton of renaming, this could be O(n^2)...
;oh well.
;(I guess I could map "var" to "next unused n")
;(and given N > n, just bump that up to N+1, skipping over
; n+1 through N-1)

;all right...
;closure conversion next? or what?
;jesus christ...
;I think I can do assignment conversion here.
;

;ok, refs become (fake-ref x) or (global 'x)
;assignments become (fake-assign x val) or (global-assign 'x val),
;and initializations become (let x (fake-box 'x)).
;the fake things will be macros that will expand to plain x,
;(assign x val), and ...
;hmm. I could make (fake-box ...
;ok, because this is cps, you will only be able to (fake-box <constant>)
;or (fake-box <var>/<lambda>) in the first place.
;rather, you would only be able to bind x to <constant>/<var>/<lambda>
;in the first place... hmm... hmm... with bindings, x will init.'ly just
;appear in an arglist. we will replace this with 

;hmm. as is suggested by Shivers's example, I can do this outside of
;any cps. 

;shall we ignore mutated global vars?
;neh.
;set-subtract them later.
;... and as for set subtraction?
;let this shit deal with tables, it makes things easier.

;gw'oh, fuck. this would work differently on cps and not,
;because ...
;hmm...
;eh, I guess I can do it in a couple of ways.
;the way I'm doing is this:
;- assign -> mark odd-positioned dicks (which shd be symbols) as mutated,
;  and then just recur on all arguments.
(def mutated-vars (x)
  (let m (table)
    (xloop (x x)
      (when acons.x
        (if (is car.x 'fn)
            (map next cddr.x)
            (is car.x 'quote)
            nil
            (is car.x 'assign)
            (do (xloop (x cdr.x)
                  (when (and acons.x (acons cdr.x))
                    (= (m car.x) t)
                    (next cddr.x)))
              (map next x))
            ;else funcall
            (map next x))))
    m))

;now these macros will _not_ be expanded throughout cps work.
;(global-assign 'x val)
;... eeeyes, we might as well have this work on non-cps.
;... though... can we make it handle both?
;let's try...
;(global-assign 'x val 'y val ... [cont])
;(mac global-assign vvs
;actually, that doesn't need to be a macro... not really.
;weh...
;eh, sure.
;(mac global-assign vvs
;  (if no.vvs
;      nil
;      
;no...
;ok, without CPS someone shall turn (assign x 1 y 2 ...)
;into (do (global-assign 'x 1) (fake-assign y 2) ...).
;and with cps someone shall turn (assign x 1 y 2 ... k)
;into ...
;dammit...
;ok, will it in fact be possible 
;(I am running into issues of uniq-counters and whatever
; and I had the wonderful idea of using increments by 2 or so
; to partition that space of stuff...)
;will it in fact be possible to avoid allocating another name?
;(the "x'" as a parameter to accept whatever value from whatever
; calls the continuation, and then the "x" to hold the box)
;I suspect not.
;however, I do want, and think I can, have all boxes be allocated
;as part of envs.
;furthermore, once they are, any need for the "x" variable should
;become unnecessary. there should already be a var to hold "env",
;and then it becomes [env + 8n], and x should drop out of env.
;mmm... that's probably a good intermediate representation for
;env vars. offsets from env, but the offsets not yet chosen:
;[env + x-offset].
;know only that env has length equal to the number of vars stored
;in it, and that would also be represented as a variable in interm.
;stuff.

;ok, so, I will have to bind a nonce variable.
;rework the continuation...
;mmm...
            
      
;assign is implemented such that (= y z x y) should bind x to z,
;so it is appropriate to convert to sequential like this.
(def install-global (sym val)
  (($ namespace-set-variable-value!) sym val))
#;(mac fake-box (x) ;(let x 3) becomes (let x (fake-box 3))
  x)
;damn, cps-eval is not well eq'd to deal with macros...
;I guess I'll have to fix that.
;... no, too hard...
;shall write diff. versions.
;and the converter shall... work on both cps and not.
;(this eliminates error checking on num args passed to assign)
;(lolz)
#;(mac cps-fake-box (x k)
  `(,k ,x))

(mac fake-assign (x val)
  `(assign ,x ,val))
(mac cps-fake-assign (x val k)
  `(,k (assign ,x ,val)))

;eh... that fake-box thing can be written as a function
;and I think I shall actually do that.
(def fake-box (x)
  x)
(def fake-contents (x)
  x)

;oh right, global value
(def global-value (x)
  (symbol-value x))

;trust to later shit...

;(def convert-globals (x)
;no, don't really want to convert globals alone
;because that would mean having to break up
;an assign of multiple things... which... is doable.

;this will convert assigns as needed.
;and will be like cps one way and normal another way.

;at least this is de-macro'd and variable-renamed.
;... is it? I could even avoid doing that.
;let's do that.

;mmm... in theory, I might use some concept of "primops".
;making + become (global-value '+) reflects a bit of commitment
;to something different from what I'm used to reading.
;welp. gotta make use of global bindings.
;

;threading is the crap that makes crap most difficult.
;A calls B calls A, or loop repeatedly calls A and B.
;[sleep cycle] in that case it seems I'd have to keep checking
;whether A or B has been modified...
;but... mmm...

;single-threading is good...
;and creating restrictions that emulate it is good.
;methinks a good thing is having a tree of global variables
;be never modified directly, only replaced with an updated
;tree. (this means the values would not be a field in the symbol
;object; they'd be a field in an "item"/node object that also
;contained a symbol pointer, used as a key.)
;

;suppose we check A, having value A1;
;do some work;
;check B, having value B1;
;check A, having value A1.
;now, can we be sure we never have to check B or A again in this
;loop? (assuming we don't check anything else in the loop)
;(I am basically attempting to maintain what could be called the
; "x86 memory model", or could be called a relativistic memory
; model.)
;hmmph, this is pretty restrictive.  if the loop iterates over
;an array, or list, or otherwise keeps accessing new cells of
;memory, then we're pretty screwed. for each value X1 we see in
;a new memory cell X, it could be that it was X0 beforehand and
;some thread set A to A2, then set X to X1, in which case we
;cannot pretend to have not gotten around to checking A yet.
;however, let's see what we can do even with this restrictive crap.
;might be useful for numerical algorithms... (oh, and freshly-alloc'd
;things can be assumed ours--oh man, that does give a lot more
;freedom...)

;we check A, see A1.
;do work. [this is unnecessary for proofs, but it seems it must be
; kept in mind for efficiency analysis or something, and in general
; our work might cause B to have a value at all; so we can't just
; read A and B at the start.]
;check B, see B1.
;-> expect to see only A and B in near future.
;check A, see A1 still.
;-> in this case, as long as we're not reading or writing anything
;   other than private memory, we should be able to tell the story
;   "we finished all our work before any modifications to A or B
;    showed up".

;how about three.
;check A, see A1.
;do work.
;check B, see B1.
;artificially check A, still see A1.
;do work.
;check C, see C1.
;artificially check A, B, A, still see A1 B1 A1 resp.
;then I think we win.

;... terrible... O(n^2), it would seem...
;see...
;if we check B, see B1, art. check A, still see A1,
;then either:
;- no one changed A before changing B to B1
;- someone changed A before changing B to B1, but then [they or smn else]
;  changed it back, either before or after changing B to B1
;

;oh my god, not even two works.
;imgn that A and B are initially... undefined, say,
;and a demon observes us and, when it perceives we're about to
;observe either A or B, it sets the other one to 0, then the first
;one to 1.  now, we will only ever see that A=1 and B=1; however,
;when we observe A=1, that implies that B had been set to 0 beforehand,
;and so by having seen the later assignment A=1, we can't pretend that
;"B=0" is in the future.
;the _only_ thing that works is assuming crap about a _single_
;external (externally controllable) memory cell.
;so... this brings me to my desired approach.

;use AVL tree or eqv 
;[two sleep cycles, red Okasaki's random access lists and
; some of his thesis]
;(... thinking of allocating specially small singleton trees)

;[one or two sleep cycles]
;ok, um...
;I can have a bunch of functions, compiled together (or effectively),
;that know how to call each other, and that can assume each other will
;not _unexpectedly_ redefine each other.
;with the advent of politeness (i.e. 

;(oh and btw the scheme of having dumb functions check for GC-flip right
; _before_ calling registered functions has a problem; GC-flip could
; occur in between the check and the call; if you want to do that, you
; would need to register at least that ending portion 



;[sleep cycles...]
;note that cps seems to be not entirely correct
;... considering this model:
;each single thread will persist in using the set of globals as they
;were defined when it started.
;...
;

;[sleep cycles]
;Interpreter semantics.
;First-class macros and stuff.
;If x = (macro (Î» args . body))),
;then the expression (x nerf ...)
;shall be interpreted by a pseudo-compiler
;as (eval-with-lexenv ((Î» args . body) nerf ...) <env if any>).
;Functions get compiled, as far as possible, when they are
;about to be run.
;If 

;Do note it's conceivable that, even if a macro is smthg like

(fn (x) (fake-plus x 3))
;substitute macro crap
(fn (x) (eval/lex (fake-plus.1 'x '3) (obj x x)))

(fn (x) (eval/lex ((fn args (++ n) `(+ ,@args)) 'x '3)

;the compiler determines it is fine to do this:

  (let new-n (+ n 1)
    (assign n new-n)
    (eval/lex (cons '+ (list 'x '3))
              (obj x x))))
;and then... oh man... _oh man_... smthg like this
(fn (x)
  (let new-n (+ n 1)
    (assign n new-n)
    (apply +

             (map [eval/lex _ env]
                  (list 'x '3))))))
;perhaps more literal/explicit, or perhaps we will
;just decide to expand it here, like this:
(fn (x)
  (let new-n (+ n 1)
    (assign n new-n)
    (apply +
           (let env (obj x x)
             (list (eval/lex 'x env)
                   (eval/lex '3 env))))))
;and then... hmm, actually, it probably shoulda been like this

(fn (x)
  (let new-n (+ n 1)

      (withs arg1 (eval/lex 'x env)
             arg2 (eval/lex 3 env)
        (+ arg1 arg2)))))
;and then this should become
(fn (x)
  (let new-n (+ n 1)

    (let env (obj x x)

             arg2 3

(fn (x)
  (let new-n (+ n 1)
    (assign n new-n)
    (withs arg1 x
      arg2 3
      (+ arg1 arg2))))
;sub. older names
(fn (x)
  (let new-n (+ n 1)
    (assign n new-n)
    (withs arg1 x
      arg2 3
      (+ x 3))))
;and drop newer names
(fn (x)
  (let new-n (+ n 1)
    (assign n new-n)
    (+ x 3)))
;This is how it should be.  Ideally.
;This will trivially "yes, keep giant old dicks in lexenv".
;If you want those to be GC'd, figure it out.
;(Or write code that can be fully compiled and that can drop
