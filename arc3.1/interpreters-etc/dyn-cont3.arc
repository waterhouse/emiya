;load this with ssx-load

;ok, what representation is it this time?
;shall we revert to `(closure ,env ,args ,body)?
;heh, why not.
;and then ... ah yes. my goal was to have some kind
;of exception handlers and crap...
;therefore...
;continuations.
;hmm...

;there was that experimental approach to making envs,
;where an item saved in the closure would describe the
;structure of the env field(s), and usually partial eval
;would eliminate all references to it.
;in a straight interpreter like this, this is a pretty
;dumb idea, because there is never more than one closure
;that shares a particular env structure.
;... however, I shall do it anyway. lolz.
;kk yeah...
;... hmm...
;actually, no. screw.

;I will want dynamic variables.
;Which will not actually be variables.
;As in Racket, they will be first-class objects, which will
;be called like functions (although I could change the latter)
;to obtain their value.
;I will probably have to think for a while about "space safety"
;with this crap. How it might be obtained.
;... Btw, should d(ynamic env) and e(nv) be completely separate,
;or can one be contained in the other?
;Fuck whatever. Neh.


;Executive decision:
;"Native procedures" will still exist as distinct from user closures,
;but they will use continuation-passing style.
;Furthermore, actually, they will take their continuation as an
;additional _first_ argument.
;Hey, I can use something I learned to slightly reduce allocation
;on the native Arc... (knowing 'bout arglists to avoid rest args)
;This will reinforce a separation between "procedures used" and
;"procedures exported", I suppose.
;... Um. They also need to take the dynamic environment.
;Well, we shall do that.
;Btw.
;The argument for putting the cont argument and other things first
;is that, in the native thing, there will be one register always used
;for the cont argument, and one register always used for the dyn-env
;argument, and so on.  (Self [i.e. env/closure] would be another. And
; some registers would probably be reserved for global and thread-local
; BS.) Independent of how many arguments are passed to a function.
;The first argument to a procedure is always found in the same place, no
;matter how many other arguments are passed.
;The last argument to a procedure is found in different places depending on
;how mayn other arguments are passed.
;Therefore, special arguments like k,d,e should go first in the calling
;convention.

;ok, so, I will need a special form to parameterize things.
;is there any point in having "parameterize multiple things"
;be a primitive?  I don't think so. maybe conceivably with atomic

;mmmyes. "dwith" should just be a macro. meanwhile I shall
;have a "dlet".
;... actually... does dlet even need to be ... I think it can be
;a procedure.  --well, except for the body portion.
;'course, many things could be written with a "more primitive"
;procedure that takes a thunk, with the usual form written as a
;macro on top of that.
;is there any reason to prefer one over the other?
;well, macro output of the non-thunk form looks much better, and
;is less verbose.
;meanwhile, if most of your BS depends on thunks, as in Racket,
;then it's easy for some idiot to run some completely different
;language on top of it (although, if your compiler isn't amazing,

;ok actually I'm going to imitate Arc and be like "making a macro
; from a fn can be a procedure".

;I am faced with a strong temptation to have macros not use the
;dynamic environment.
;Hmm...
;Recall that a macro is like saying (eval `(...)).
;So the question is then: should "eval" use the current dyn-env or not?
;...

;Hohoho. Racket provides a (current-parameterization).
;... As well as call-with-parameterization.

;By the way, quasiquote kind of could be a macro...
;... Interesting.
;If you say (eval `(...)), then what is used to compute
;the macro definitely depends on the current dyn-env.
;Therefore macex'ing should do that.
;As for how the result is eval'd--well, of course, yes.
;So, yes.
;Then what should user eval be?
;Well, ... if the user defined it as a procedure, then ...
;calling it would use the current dyn-env.
;A separate "eval in blank env" could be provided if desired.
;Also the lexenv could be specified, defaulting to nil.
;In the interest of laziness, I shall not provide that myself yet.
;However, user "apply" is definitely in core Arc.

;note that user "apply" will be bound to a tricky macro.
;(mc (f . args) (eval (cons `',f args))).
;that suffices.
;... actually, must be careful to have the right dyn-env.

;(= user-apply
;   `(macro (closure (f . args)

;OMGAW a continuation is supposed to contain the dynamic env
;...
;...
;um...
;actually, that should probably be saved elsewhere

;ok, now we have the problem that the continuation fucking looks different
;from normal closures--only taking one argument...
;Racket continuations are procedures, but not vice versa...
;aha, yes, I recall.
;according to the Appel, what we do is have call-cc actually save a wrapper
;closure-compatible procedure.
;now, this bothers me, because this will create a new procedure each time.
;if, for example, you save a continuation where you're just about to call
;call/cc and use that to save _that_ continuation somewhere, then successive
;calls to the first continuation will produce different objects that are
;supposed to represent the identical second continuation.
;Probably not acceptable.
;Anyway, it appears that the native solution will just have all continuations
;silently ignore the k,d arguments that are passed to it.
;Then there will be no need for duplication.
;As for me...
;Can I guarantee object identity by using some idiot hash table?
;Eeeyes, although it might be a bit strange that separate cases of
;having the continuation be idfn (which is one procedure) would yield
;the same continuation.
;In fact, what Arc should really do is use its own ccc and supply the
;resulting continuation to ueval.
;Well, anyway.

;the cont really should be usable as a user closure.
;however, for now, I must make a wrapper closure around it.

;I am going to rapidly copy the R7RS exception system.
;So there's a raise function.
;It takes one argument and calls the current exception handler on that argument.
;Exception handlers should take one argument.
;Also, when called, they will find the default exception handler to be
;whatever it was when they were... created.
;Or bound or whatever.
;In general they'll find
;Now, a one-argument function will become a function that
;takes probably a few arguments, in my case...

;A closure should remain consistent. Same like with making continuations.
;Actually, these sort of are continuations.
;... Are they necessarily continuations?
;... 
;... No.
;An exception handler for "raise-continuable", if it returns, will return
;to where "raise-continuable" was called.
;I guess that means the continuation it's passed is the continuation of
;the "raise-continuable" expression.
;Meanwhile, an exception handler for "raise", if it returns, will "call
; some parent exception handler".
;That means the continuation it's passed (as k) is the parent exception
;handler. I am going to specify that it's the prior value of the
;"current-exception-handler" dynvar.

;A "continuation" will just be a function that happens to ignore its
;continuation argument (and never returns--these are eqv).

;Let's see...
;The exn handler itself must have its entire dyn-env stored within it.
;So...
;The closure that is the usual exception handler should 

;... I got confused about closures and continuations again.
;Call-cc in the interpreted Lisp is implemented with a bit of leaking
;of the fact of continuations in the compiled Lisp.
;The compiled Lisp is therefore written in continuation-passing style,
;or mostly so, to make this convenient.
;The usual continuations of the compiled Lisp only take one explicit argument.
;However, all closures of the 

;Ok, 

;... Suppose there's a user closure, f.
;If we execute the user code (f (g x)),
;this is equivalent to being like
;(uapply g d list.x [f _]).
;Hmm...
;Lolz.
;I may be a complete idiot... maybe.
;Eh, nah.
;So.
;Suppose we are like
;(f (g (h x))).
;This is like
;(uapply h d list.x [uapply g d list._ [uapply f d list._ k]]).
;Suppose that g('s body) is (ccc (fn (c) (push c safe-place) ...)).
;In that case, ideally, c should get bound to that exact closure:
;[uapply f d list._ k].
;And so my dictum about having a sticky-noted user-closure that represents
;that continuation makes sense.
;Incidentally, that thing contains the d it'll use.

;Ok, so, then, what happens when we try to pass off a user-closure as
;an exception handler.
;Well, in the above case, it's impossible for the user to write code
;that makes his user closure be the continuation.
;You may have g save the continuation in (f (g x)),
;but the continuation is not f (the user closure),
;but [uapply f d list._ k] (the compiled-Lisp continuation-closure).
;
;Things are probably coming to a resolution...
;In the case of the continuations, it is generally done like
;(withs k1 [uapply f d list._ k]
;       k2 [uapply g d list._ k1]
;  (uapply h d list.x k2))
;or, at least, it can in theory be done like that.
;In that case [I wrote cakes], it seems only right that call/cc
;should capture the exact arguments k2 and k1.
;Whereas 

;call-with-exn-handler will have to create a new closure
;(a compiled-Lisp continuation) given the user closure that it's given.
;it will contain the information "call this user closure with the dyn-env
; captured at time of creation". note that you could call-with-exn-handler
;the identical closure at different times, with different dynamic envs,
;and so obviously the resulting closure 
;call-cc targets a continuation that already exists by the time call-cc
;is called.
;call-with-exn-handler ... does not.
;incidentally, if the user clasure passed to call-with-exn-handler
;is _actually_ a continuation, then it'll ignore the dyn-env it's passed.
;it is conceivable that a compiler or runtime that understood this would cause
;that crap to just keep that user closure.

;Let's see.
;Thus far, the user hasn't been able to directly touch compiled-Lisp
;continuations. ccc provides "them", but what it provides is actually
;a continuation wrapped in a user closure.  (I may be able to get
; rid of that distinction.)
;(Though I now see that, since it must save the dyn-env, I can't
; actually save ... Fuck, shut up, stop confusing yourself.)
;However, I want the exn-handler dynvar to be plain and user-accessible.
;This has led to some confusion in my brain.
;I guess that, for this iteration, the user will have access to strange
;objects, and in the next iteration, ...
;Fuck.
;Ok, according to "raise-continuable" an exception handler will need to
;accept a k argument. Thus, user closure signature.
;I see.
;First iteration: no raise-continuable; exceptions are continuations.
;Second iteration: all continuations have closure signature...
;...

;> (let ((z (make-parameter 8))) (call-with-exception-handler (lambda (x) (displayln x) (displayln (z)) (raise x)) (lambda () (parameterize ((z 15)) (raise "H" #t)))))
;H
;15
;raise called (with non-exception value) by exception handler: "H"; original raise called (with non-exception value): "H"

;So. How can you bind the exception handler to something else (creating dyn-env #2),
;then bind z to something else (creating dyn-env #3),
;then raise an exception in a dyn-env that obviously doesn't contain the first
;binding but does contain the second?
;Likely, Racket claims it ...
;Oh. It's R7RS that sez: "The system implicitly maintains a current
; exception handler in the dynamic environment."
;Well. Anyway.
;raise shall use the dyn-env saved in the exn-handler.
;(It'll use the current dyn-env to find that exn-handler, but.)

;... Um.
;It doesn't look like I can arrange for the definition of "raise"
;to have "return from exn handler" mean "call parent exn handler".
;It could only find that parent exn handler inside the closure that
;is the current exn handler, and since it is, as Shivers says, "Church-
; encoded", that is not permissible.
;So I do in fact nead some kind of "backup" or "uncaught" or "whatever
; exception handler".
;... R7RS sez that, if the "raise"d thing returns, a secondary exception
;is raised in the same dynamic environment as that thing.
;Right ho.

;... WTF.
;The R7RS sez that, when raise[-continuable]ing, the exn-handler procedure
;should be called in an identical dyn-env to the call to "raise", except
;for the fact that the exn-handler will be rebound to the dick saved in
;the exn-handler.
;Fuck.
;...
;... I may have to accept that as being a good idea.
;The most obvious dynvars so far, other than exn-handler, are stdin/out/error.
;If you parameterize stderr to be something else, then raise an error,
;it seems fairly obvious that what should be done is that stderr should stay
;being something else in the exn handler.
;It would be frustrating if you couldn't do that.
;Meanwhile, given this model, it seems easy to do the first model: save
;a continuation with the dyn-env you want, and have the exn handler call
;(or be) that continuation.

;Ok, so far it looks like things are basically working...
;Then what about call/cc?
;Hmm...
;I could have a special value for call/cc, treated specially by ... by uapply.
;I could have all system procs be forced to accept a cont argument.
;And I could make all closures into [ptr + env], and also make all system procs
; look like that.
;The first option is ugly.
;The second option seems right [inevitable in a native thing], and the third option
;is really kind of orthogonal.
;Let us then proceed.

;Right ho, it all seems to work.  Time for a bit of a standard library.
;Maybe I'll see if I can put qq into the stdlib.

;... All right, I've written a qq macro.
;Now...
;I think I'll take "chars->sym" and a few others as primitives...
;And then.
;Do I get to use ssyntax?
;...
;Actually, it seems like a good thing to do would be to put ssyntax
;into the stdlib.
;Oh man.
;Ok, then, I will need...
;- string-append
;- string->sym
;- sym->string
;- string-ref (that can be implied)
;- character comparisons
;- 

;Ok, in doing all the below,
;I am using "err" a bunch.
;I think I should make error handling a bit less magical before going
;very far.
;Oh man added chars, somewhat.
;Ok, things are probably working as is.
;I'll probably want an actual "char" function,
;and whatnot, that throws proper errors.
;Oh man.
