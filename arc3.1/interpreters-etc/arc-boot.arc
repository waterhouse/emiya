;I am staggered.
;Well. It would appear that I really need de-macro.
;General theory: I will need to essentially have a repository of which
;functions are "cuddly", which means they can be executed on constant
;arguments without causing strange things like side effects (and poss.
; type-error exceptions; I'm not sure exactly how I'll handle that).
;This information will be used by a de-macroizer/compiler.
;It seems that, in fact, I will need useful information about each function,
;rather than just substituting the source of each function as I simulate
;calling it, and doing everything atomically.
;(E.g. this means saying "map + xs is cuddly" and executing map at
; compile-time, rather than substituting the definition of "map" at
; each iteration.
; Incidentally, in the case of "map", it really depends on what the
; function is--the function has to be known and cuddly, I guess.
; And maybe the list has to be known and non-circular--maybe lists
; or data structures in general are cuddly when they're non-circular.)
;It would certainly be more efficient...
;... So some primitive functions would certainly have to be labeled by God
;(aka programmer) as cuddly. Then the system should be able to deduce
;that functions built from those are cuddly as well. (How about termination?
; ... That's certainly an argument for the "atomic" approach, sigh.
; Maybe the system can get good at automatically deducing termination.)

;Anyway, that would be the general theory.
;In this case, I'll probably introduce de-macro and ssx,
;and at that point *I* will know that all macro-functions are cuddly,
;and be sure because I wrote them.
;Then I can do that kidnap-your-closures-and-replace-them-with-clever-
;imitations-in-the-night thing. For efficiency!
;That will require some new primitives (closure-body, closure-env, etc.)
;... Um. Square that with the usual model of closure.

;Incidentally, blithely macexing stuff will change semantics.
;Suppose we macex "map".
;If we then pass a macro as the "f" argument to "map", the macro
;will get passed different stuff.
;It is possible to handle that, though.
;Just generate code that asks if "f" is a macro (or special form),
;and if so, it calls "f" on the actual source code and on a (lazily
; constructed?) lexenv.

;But, at any rate, I won't care about changing the semantics in that
;way for the code I'm writing and running.
;(Half of it isn't even written the way I'd like it to be.)
;

;... It seems like most closures will have to be assumed non-cuddly,
;unless they are specifically accounted for in the global bindings.
;This is because it seems it would be too much overhead to change all
;closures...........
;That seems like a terrible reason.
;Yeah, it pretty much is.
;It shouldn't be difficult to change all closures that are created
;from known closures.
;... Actually, yes, it should.
;(After re-macroexpansion, the code that created
; some old closure can become unrecognizable.)
;Continuations, continuations, continuations. And closures.
;Let's see.
;Cases.
;- make-counter is bound to a globvar.
;A made counter is bound to a globvar.
;It is straightforward that modifying the make-counter should do nothing
;to the existing made counter, and redefining some crap
;that the made counter depends on should cause the made
;counter to get recompiled.
;This goes if there are a lot of made counters in globvars, too, because there
;generally aren't too many globvars.
;They should probably share the code in some way.
;Next... some made closures will hide outside globvars (or inside big
; structures that are bound to globvars).
;

;Closures that are kind-of-compiled like this (that have been optimized under
; ass'ns) should just begin with code that says "check if ass'ns have been
; invalidated". Thus, compiled closures, when they create compiled continuation-
;closures, should make closures-that-begin-with-a-check (unless you happen to
; know exactly where that closure will be and when it will die).

;Well, then, I can proceed as planned...

;Get more sophisticated later.

;ok, and now, I will need to reexpand everything.
;... ...
;that can't really be done nicely and efficiently
;(nicely = get the original source code to ev'thing and then
; reexpand it)
;(efficiently = less than O(n^2))
;without a real table or some kind of dumb hash thing to sort
;closures...
;I guess I should move back to the "sym -> original code" model,
;rather than "closure -> closure".
;ok, and then...

;I guess it would be good if I could sort things or something...
;feh.
;ah...
;I can make some kind of queue structure: insert at the end,
;and verify that certain desired things are first.
;This is without needing to compare two symbols (to see which is greater,
; that is).
;Well, let's see what happens if I just fuck it.

;Guh.
;Takes .8 seconds to reexpand-all,
;and takes much longer to "reexpand-just" the-order.
;I really should have something that can recompile (/reexpand)
;things "under a new binding".
;That'd make this shit faster.
;Redefining fn and having to reexpand everything at once...
;It's like cutting off all your limbs and having to survive in the
;meantime while they regrow, whereas one would like to be able to
;cut off individual limbs and let each one regrow while you have
;all the other limbs still fully usable to help you survive in the meantime.
;Actually, it'd be more like growing a new limb and then cutting off
;the old one and replacing it in the same movement.
;Perhaps even growing a full new set of limbs and replacing them all
;in immediate succession could be done... that is how it must be for
;some kinds of changes, anyway.
;(As a matter of fact, this whole bootstrapping thing kind of is that.)

;Although it would also make it possible to get into weird situations
;that might be philosophically troubling: e.g. if you go and decide
;to recompile everything... ... well, the idea is that you might not
;be able to reexpand everything, you might get some circular crap...
;But I think that probably isn't ...
;Hmm.
;My task here, for bootstrapping, is to provide a bunch of functions
;and some macros. 


;Btw, another option is to just expand the already-expanded stuff.
;That would work fine on the existing closures.

;Well, anyway.
;.8 seconds ain't bad, especially since it'll probably run faster
;when the base interpreter is written in assembly.
;Plus earlier crap probably takes longer anyway.

;... ... Ok, what next?
;I guess I had called for reading and files.
;Oh boy. Oh dear. Oh no. Jez'.
;And maybe tables. I had 

;I remember at some point realizing there was something seriously
;wrong with my implementation of "read"... I suspect it was a
;relatively minor issue, though... hmmph.


;right ho.
;on next iteration, I guess I'll have to upgrade the
;de-macro thing to ask "is this bound to fn-object?"
;rather than "is this 'fn", so that I can implement
;optional arguments as a macro to replace fn.
