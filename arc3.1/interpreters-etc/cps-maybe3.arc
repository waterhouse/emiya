;Let's see if I can rederive crap from scratch...
;crap being CPS.

;...
;I... shall I use Shivers's thing,
;where ((fn dicks ass) nerf) is an acceptable CPS
;expression?
;I suppose I might as well.
;The alternatives involve either potentially-infinite
;expansion, global analysis to extract things,
;or some semi-silly FIX form that isn't global.

;We shall assume (and, separately, ensure)
;input that is a fully macex'd and desyntax'd Arc expression.
;(... Yes, that can be done in essentially a single pass;
; if a macro generates ssyntax output somehow, at least it'll
; only be in the resulting expression.  --This assumes no one
; mutates the source code while you're examining it. Hoo boy.)

;Eh... I guess it's even possible that I could
;interleave these two things.
;But eh.

;I decided that QUOTE things should be perceived as constants.
;If the structure must be constructed at runtime, then someone
;will have to figure out about that.
;(Like, if the procedure will construct a new one every time
;it's called, then that violates the semantics of QUOTE.
;If you want to quote some nontrivial data structure, like a
;list, and if your runtime doesn't support lists being in
;some kind of file-mmap'd, read-only portion of memory that
;gets mmap'd when you execute a file or load a shared library,
;then your runtime had better figure out how to deal with that,
;allocating such a list in a place of memory that it can handle
;at the time that the code is compiled or loaded--perhaps when
;it's run for the first time (perhaps that also means compiled
;with JIT compilation)--and storing a pointer to it in a place
;that the code can access, and maintaining such a pointer
;when/if the list is moved by the GC.
;If your runtime doesn't support QUOTE, then certainly I don't
;have to handle it here.)

;Ok, so, here I face the question:
;((actually-fn) (x) (+ x 3))
; where (actually-fn) = (macro () 'fn)
;leads to what?
;In my interpreter, that is definitely the same
;as (fn (x) (+ x 3)).
;In arc3.1 and Racket and Chicken
;[lolz, I go about 5 things up in rlwrap csi history and I find
; this exact example]
;and sbcl, that is an error.
;A macro that simply expands to the name of a macro is an error,
;in these languages.
;I dislike this...
;However, I seem to be giving in to having macros locked in at
;compile time, and needing to hack in the proper behavior
;through other means in some other way.
;Mmm...
;I think I shall hold fast to that.
;So.

;... Conservative approximation.
;... Fuck.

;Semantically, I think it is important to have what some call

;... So far, no attempts to handle circular code structures...

;E.g. (bq-cons a b), or (cons a b), or (<unique-name cons> a b).
;I'm going for the first, and having them defined as macros.
;Fortunately, ... ... how was I going to finish that sentence?
;Ah, yes: fortunately, (dick x) that macex's to (quote x) is still
;treated the same in arc3.1 as (quote x) in the first place.

;So.
;This basically should, I think, return an expression made up purely
;of (bq-cons x y) and (bq-quote x).  That is to say:
;expr = (bq-quote <anything>) or (bq-cons expr expr).
;I guess one can be excessively dumb and bq-quote numbers anyway.
;And then have bq-quote macex somewhat nicely.
;(Or not.)

;(the alternative approach is somehow returning multiple

;I would want to beta-reduce fuckin' crap
;but I think I should closure-convert before I do that
;and to closure-convert, I shall need to know about free variables
;and speaking of which, I should figure out about renaming dicks.
;let us do that.

;we will let the first binding of "v" remain "v",
;and subsequent bindings should become "v1", "v2", ... .
;now, if someone happens to have named a variable "v1"
;already, then this will cause a little problem.
;we would then rename _that_ variable "v3" or wtvr.
;thus, we need to parse out the last number from an
;existing var.
;we shall have a hash table of renamings.
;... shall I do this destructively?
;mmm...

;free vars will be left alone.
;(like constants and shit)
;be careful not to rename nil.

;to compute the renaming for vn,
;we simply find the first v[n+k]
;for which there isn't a binding in the table.
;hmm...
;ok.
;hmm... in this...
;fn and quote are the special forms.
;(interestingly, both will eventually imply entries in a FIX)
;I suppose there's also assign, which hasn't been conv'd yet.
;oh well.
;... if no renaming is needed, I think I can just rename
;a variable to itself. bweheheh.
;... I think I shall have no var0's,
;and I think I shall never rename var[n] to var[m < n].
;so, given var[], I compute n to be 0,
;and given var and n, I look at var[n] and then var[n+1]
;and so on.
;if there's a fuckton of renaming, this could be O(n^2)...
;oh well.
