;I need a reliable, dumb pretty-print.

             (if functionp.x

                 [is _ x])))
;because (isa x 'fn) -> (is (type x) 'fn)
;and (type #t) -> error.
;not sure how I would want to fix that
;so I am letting it fester.
;terrible.

;all right.  egad.  but that kinda works.
;now to improve.
              
;first with the nice things, _then_ with one-lining things
;and whatever crap.
;ok, first try what happens if you don't indent future lines
;at all to account for '`,@ crap.

;next, brackets, and I think I'll have to accept ...
;neh...
;I think this is probably fine.
;I will probably want to one-line flat lists. (Even if they happen to be
; long.)
;Also maybe the first argument of things, though... let and stuff...
;mmm.

;k, try flat crap next...


;mmm...
;a thing that really annoys me is (fn <args on next line>).
;so I'd probably work on that next...
;also not really sure about that "rest on one line" behavior.
;... time for special-casing fn only. lolz.
