;First we will write quasiquote as a macro, using quasiquote because it is convenient.
;Then we will translate it to not use quasiquote.

;I should note perhaps that Guy Steele did at least that much at the end of CLTL2.

;Exactly what should semantics be?
;Something like `(a . ,b) is actually `(a . (unquote b)),
;which is actually `(a unquote b).
;Which should not be expanded.
;I think that's the main point of contention.

;Let's see.
;Quoted things should be connected as much as possible.

;`(blah blah blah) -> (quote (blah blah blah))
;`(blah ,blah blah) -> (list* 'blah blah '(blah))
;`(blah blah ,blah) -> (list* 'blah 'blah blah 'nil) ;lolz
;`(,blah blah blah) -> (list* blah '(blah blah)) ;bahaha, cons is superseded
;`(,@blah blah blah) -> (append blah '(blah blah))
;`(blah ,@blah blah) -> (list* 'blah (append blah '(blah)))
;`(blah blah ,@blah) -> (list* 'blah 'blah blah)
;`(blah blah . ass) -> '(blah blah . ass)
;`(blah ,@blah . ass) -> (list* 'blah (append blah 'ass))

;obviously the append involved must be proper (i.e. prepared for impropriety)
;--turns out append is in fact like that in racket, CLISP, and SBCL. good.
;also in "a". good.

;methinks I may use some sentinel values and eq to do combining-ish stuff

;a major bug fixed hear
;[I suspect I'll use this]
;also shortened some other crap

;Btw, me thinking about the exact details of (unquote ,@crap) and things seems
;a bit like Newton thinking about theology.

;Space-safe, cheap error reporting.
;Have two thread-local vars that you use.
;One you'll assign to the error handler you want to use.
;The other you'll assign to the continuation it's supposed to correspond to.
;Not actually an error handler, but will be a source of error message.
;The second thing should probably be a weak ptr.
;Or a bit-pattern not treated like a ptr (but compared with eq if necessary).
;Or even a hash.
;This is quite separate from parameterizing an exception handler where that
;would actually be useful.


;one strategy for dealing with ,@ is to have it get handled by whosits
;guaranteed not to return an atom...
;actually, that implies I don't need weird sentinels
;...
;ok, in general...
;I might want to have some things become (idfn x).
;well, we'll see.

;ok.

;Ok, this appears to produce legal output.
;However, it's rather ugly.
;I did drop the idfn from the output, but still...
;Cosmetic issues:
;- (list* x (list* ...)) -> (list* x ...)
;- (list* x y) -> (cons x y)
;- (list* ... nil) -> (list ...) ;also (cons x nil) -> (list x), possibly
;- (append x nil) -> x, or perhaps (idfn x)
;- (append x (append y ...)) -> (append x y ...), possibly
;Also there are some redundancies in the code.

;Guh, turns out it's still not too hard to make an idfn.
;Well, we'll see.
;Oh, that's 'cause I changed a duplicated part in ex-qq but not -rest.
;Well, that solved that problem.

;Ok, code been cleaned up; it should now be easy to combine things.
