;load this with ssx-load

;ok, what representation is it this time?
;shall we revert to `(closure ,env ,args ,body)?
;heh, why not.
;and then ... ah yes. my goal was to have some kind
;of exception handlers and crap...
;therefore...
;continuations.
;hmm...

;there was that experimental approach to making envs,
;where an item saved in the closure would describe the
;structure of the env field(s), and usually partial eval
;would eliminate all references to it.
;in a straight interpreter like this, this is a pretty
;dumb idea, because there is never more than one closure
;that shares a particular env structure.
;... however, I shall do it anyway. lolz.
;kk yeah...
;... hmm...
;actually, no. screw.

;I will want dynamic variables.
;Which will not actually be variables.
;As in Racket, they will be first-class objects, which will
;be called like functions (although I could change the latter)
;to obtain their value.
;I will probably have to think for a while about "space safety"
;with this crap. How it might be obtained.
;... Btw, should d(ynamic env) and e(nv) be completely separate,
;or can one be contained in the other?
;Fuck whatever. Neh.


;Executive decision:
;"Native procedures" will still exist as distinct from user closures,
;but they will use continuation-passing style.
;Furthermore, actually, they will take their continuation as an
;additional _first_ argument.
;Hey, I can use something I learned to slightly reduce allocation
;on the native Arc... (knowing 'bout arglists to avoid rest args)
;This will reinforce a separation between "procedures used" and
;"procedures exported", I suppose.
;... Um. They also need to take the dynamic environment.
;Well, we shall do that.
;Btw.
;The argument for putting the cont argument and other things first
;is that, in the native thing, there will be one register always used
;for the cont argument, and one register always used for the dyn-env
;argument, and so on.  (Self [i.e. env/closure] would be another. And
; some registers would probably be reserved for global and thread-local
; BS.) Independent of how many arguments are passed to a function.
;The first argument to a procedure is always found in the same place, no
;matter how many other arguments are passed.
;The last argument to a procedure is found in different places depending on
;how mayn other arguments are passed.
;Therefore, special arguments like k,d,e should go first in the calling
;convention.

(def ueval (x d e k)
  ;(prsn 'ueval x d e k)

;ok, so, I will need a special form to parameterize things.
;is there any point in having "parameterize multiple things"
;be a primitive?  I don't think so. maybe conceivably with atomic
;crap... but no, you don't lock anyone else, you just...
;mmmyes. "dwith" should just be a macro. meanwhile I shall
;have a "dlet".
;... actually... does dlet even need to be ... I think it can be
;a procedure.  --well, except for the body portion.
;'course, many things could be written with a "more primitive"
;procedure that takes a thunk, with the usual form written as a
;macro on top of that.
;is there any reason to prefer one over the other?
;well, macro output of the non-thunk form looks much better, and
;is less verbose.
;meanwhile, if most of your BS depends on thunks, as in Racket,
;then it's easy for some idiot to run some completely different
;language on top of it (although, if your compiler isn't amazing,
; it may be kinda slower than it should be).
;anyway, special forms for me for the moment.

;ok actually I'm going to imitate Arc and be like "making a macro
; from a fn can be a procedure".

;I am faced with a strong temptation to have macros not use the
;dynamic environment.
;Hmm...
;Recall that a macro is like saying (eval `(...)).
;So the question is then: should "eval" use the current dyn-env or not?
;...

;Hohoho. Racket provides a (current-parameterization).
;... As well as call-with-parameterization.

;By the way, quasiquote kind of could be a macro...
;... Interesting.
;If you say (eval `(...)), then what is used to compute
;the macro definitely depends on the current dyn-env.
;Therefore macex'ing should do that.
;As for how the result is eval'd--well, of course, yes.
;So, yes.
;Then what should user eval be?
;Well, ... if the user defined it as a procedure, then ...
;calling it would use the current dyn-env.
;A separate "eval in blank env" could be provided if desired.
;Also the lexenv could be specified, defaulting to nil.
;In the interest of laziness, I shall not provide that myself yet.
;However, user "apply" is definitely in core Arc.

;note that user "apply" will be bound to a tricky macro.
;(mc (f . args) (eval (cons `',f args))).
;that suffices.
;... actually, must be careful to have the right dyn-env.

;(= user-apply
;   `(macro (closure (f . args)
;                    ,(fn (d e f ag)

;Ok, so much for any remnants of the idea that "compose" behavior
;with macros could be justified in an interpreter unless it took

;OMGAW a continuation is supposed to contain the dynamic env
;...
;...
;um...
;actually, that should probably be saved elsewhere

;ok, now we have the problem that the continuation fucking looks different
;from normal closures--only taking one argument...
;Racket continuations are procedures, but not vice versa...
;aha, yes, I recall.
;according to the Appel, what we do is have call-cc actually save a wrapper
;closure-compatible procedure.
;now, this bothers me, because this will create a new procedure each time.
;if, for example, you save a continuation where you're just about to call
;call/cc and use that to save _that_ continuation somewhere, then successive
;calls to the first continuation will produce different objects that are
;supposed to represent the identical second continuation.
;Probably not acceptable.
;Anyway, it appears that the native solution will just have all continuations
;silently ignore the k,d arguments that are passed to it.
;Then there will be no need for duplication.
;As for me...
;Can I guarantee object identity by using some idiot hash table?
;Eeeyes, although it might be a bit strange that separate cases of
;having the continuation be idfn (which is one procedure) would yield
;the same continuation.
;In fact, what Arc should really do is use its own ccc and supply the
;resulting continuation to ueval.
;Well, anyway.

;the cont really should be usable as a user closure.
;however, for now, I must make a wrapper closure around it.
