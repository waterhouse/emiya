;Ok, here I am going to rein in the complexity and unnecessariness.
;Clean things up for other people.
;... In particular, when I write unwritable but nameable things,
;I'll use ... hmm...
;Ok, um...
;Ok.
;For some symbol s,
;I will have (cons s 'nil) be the override object.
;(list <override> <name>) will still be how you write
;unwritable objects.
;I will also have s be bound to a macro that takes 0 arguments
;and produces 
;... ... ... Dammit, noob.
;Doesn't work in general when crap is quoted.
;But.
;I could ...
;Hmm.
;I suppose probably the best thing to do is hack the Scheme reader.
;Well, then.


;Now that stuff works... things I can do.
;0. Example with amb. Pure user code. Meh.
;1. Threads, faked by screwing with ccall or smthg to sometimes
;   save the closure and call something else for a while. Screw
;   that for the moment.
;2. Serializing everything. [done, maybe want cleanup]

;Btw, "alist" should be renamed, perhaps to "a-list", and "alist"
;should construct an alist.
;... Next will... um... dhnumb.

;Time to make safe-mapping-write less verbose.
;I.e. eliminate unnecessary datum labels.
;('Tis el baddo.)
;... hmm.
;It is indeed a good idea to separate dicks out...
;safe-replace is probably sufficient.

; printed in the global-value table will probably refer to the code;
; then ... ok, not necessarily, but whatever. I could just add a
; known table as well. Note that the symbol "meh" and the meh-code
; object will be different objects and will have different numbers
; associated with them; the task is then to figure out which is which.
; So print a list where the first item is a list of code dicks.

;so the issue with call/cc is that there are two kinds of closures,
;user closures and conts, with diff. calling conventions (conts
; take no cont argument, closures take one cont argument), and
;if they have equal status, so that a given variable x could be
;bound to either a cont or a user closure, then that is problematic.
;me solves this by making call/cc wrap its cont in a user-closure.
;now time to check the Appel.
