;First we will write quasiquote as a macro, using quasiquote because it is convenient.
;Then we will translate it to not use quasiquote.

;I should note perhaps that Guy Steele did at least that much at the end of CLTL2.

;Exactly what should semantics be?
;Something like `(a . ,b) is actually `(a . (unquote b)),
;which is actually `(a unquote b).
;Which should not be expanded.
;I think that's the main point of contention.

;Let's see.
;Quoted things should be connected as much as possible.

;`(blah blah blah) -> (quote (blah blah blah))
;`(blah ,blah blah) -> (list* 'blah blah '(blah))
;`(blah blah ,blah) -> (list* 'blah 'blah blah 'nil) ;lolz
;`(,blah blah blah) -> (list* blah '(blah blah)) ;bahaha, cons is superseded
;`(,@blah blah blah) -> (append blah '(blah blah))
;`(blah ,@blah blah) -> (list* 'blah (append blah '(blah)))
;`(blah blah ,@blah) -> (list* 'blah 'blah blah)
;`(blah blah . ass) -> '(blah blah . ass)
;`(blah ,@blah . ass) -> (list* 'blah (append blah 'ass))

;obviously the append involved must be proper (i.e. prepared for impropriety)
;--turns out append is in fact like that in racket, CLISP, and SBCL. good.
;also in "a". good.

;methinks I may use some sentinel values and eq to do combining-ish stuff

;Btw, me thinking about the exact details of (unquote ,@crap) and things seems
;a bit like Newton thinking about theology.

;Space-safe, cheap error reporting.
;Have two thread-local vars that you use.
;One you'll assign to the error handler you want to use.
;The other you'll assign to the continuation it's supposed to correspond to.
;Not actually an error handler, but will be a source of error message.
;The second thing should probably be a weak ptr.
;Or a bit-pattern not treated like a ptr (but compared with eq if necessary).
;Or even a hash.
;This is quite separate from parameterizing an exception handler where that
;would actually be useful.


;one strategy for dealing with ,@ is to have it get handled by whosits
;guaranteed not to return an atom...
;actually, that implies I don't need weird sentinels
;...
;ok, in general...
;I might want to have some things become (idfn x).
;well, we'll see.

;ok.
;`(... `(,,@xs)) -> (list* ... (list* 'quasiquote (list* 'unquote xs) nil) nil)
;that be my executive decision.
;note that it would be possible to achieve the same effect with:
;(with qq 'quasiquote uq 'unquote
;  `(... (,qq (,uq ,@xs))))
;and methinks it's benign to support things that can be achieved in other ways.

;Unfortunately, adding diversity makes the code more complex.
;Oh well.

;Ok, not adding diversity yet.
;Ok, I believe I am solving the first issue and the fourth issue.
;Turns out clisp, sbcl, and racket all do do n-argument append...
;Lessee, I guess if I do do list and cons, then it'd probably be good
;for a couple of reasons to have (list x) rather than (cons x 'nil).
;Now, I have a bit of an architecture-y approach...
;Essentially, narb wants to be (make-list ''blah thing), and
;expand-qq-rest wants to use (make-cons a b).
;Well, we shall see.

;All right, the above is pretty good. I appear to handle the second and
;third issues too.
;And now the fifth.
;That is faaaaabulous.
;I think I'll clean it up a little next.
